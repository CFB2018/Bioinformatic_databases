1. The 'NCBI_Blast_nucleotides' file describes the results of performing a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search of a nucleotide sequence against the NCBI database.
The BLAST algorithm enables the comparison of nucleotide sequences against the comprehensive repository of sequences in the NCBI database, facilitating a range of applications in molecular biology. Specifically, BLAST searches can be leveraged for:
- Sequence identification: Determining the identity of unknown nucleotide sequences by querying them against the NCBI database.
- Gene function prediction: Inferring the functional roles of genes based on their sequence similarity to characterized genes in the database.
- Primer/probe specificity assessment: Evaluating the specificity of designed primers or probes by checking for potential binding sites in the NCBI database.

2. The 'NCBI_Blast_protein' file outlines the protocol for performing a protein sequence-based search.
   
3. The 'pubmed_download' file describes how to browse pubmed for data mining (text mining, co-citation analysis, gene interaction analysis).
   
4. The 'Extract_protseq' describes how to extract protein sequences with ENTREZ, PDB and EXPASY.
