#The 'NCBI-Blast' file describes the results of performing a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search of a nucleotide sequence against the NCBI database.
The BLAST algorithm enables the comparison of nucleotide sequences against the comprehensive repository of sequences in the NCBI database, facilitating a range of applications in molecular biology. Specifically, BLAST searches can be leveraged for:
- Sequence identification: Determining the identity of unknown nucleotide sequences by querying them against the NCBI database.
- Gene function prediction: Inferring the functional roles of genes based on their sequence similarity to characterized genes in the database.
- Primer/probe specificity assessment: Evaluating the specificity of designed primers or probes by checking for potential binding sites in the NCBI database.

#The 'Retrieving_Protseq' file describes extracting sequences with ENTREZ, PDB and EXPASY.
