#The NCBI-Blast file desribes blasting a nucleotide sequence on the NCBI database.
BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm to compare nucleotide sequences against sequences in the NCBI database.
This is useful in sequence identifcation, gene function prediction and to check specificity of designed primers/probes.

#The retrieving_protein_seq file describes extracting various sequences with NCBI's ENTREZ, PDB and EXPASY.
